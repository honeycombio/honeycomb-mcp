  "prompt": "I want you to conduct a multi-step analysis in the 'ms-demo' environment to find and analyze performance data. Follow these steps, using information from each step to inform the next:\n\n1. First, list all available datasets in the ms-demo environment\n2. Based on the dataset names, choose one that likely contains web service or API performance data\n3. Explore the columns in that dataset to identify latency/duration metrics\n4. Using a specific latency column you discovered, run an analysis query to find the slowest operations, broken down by an appropriate dimension\n\nMake sure each step uses information discovered in previous steps.",

    "prompt": "Evaluate whether the conversation successfully performed a progressive analysis where each step built on previous discoveries. The sequence should demonstrate:\n1. Successfully listing datasets\n2. Making an informed selection of a relevant dataset based on those results\n3. Identifying specific latency/performance columns within that dataset\n4. Using those specific columns to run a meaningful performance analysis\n\nThe key evaluation factor is whether each step demonstrates using information gathered in previous steps, showing true conversational intelligence rather than pre-programmed steps.",
